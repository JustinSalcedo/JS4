                                    TTZ is a single-page web application to
                                    handle time notions around the world. As a
                                    user or a guest, everyone can create
                                    synchronized clocks with timezones from
                                    anywhere worldwide (yes, like a train
                                    station lobby). On one side panel, users can
                                    add contacts along with timezone-adjusted
                                    watches; on the other one, they have an
                                    event list that triggers an alarm besides
                                    displaying the offset time and a list of
                                    members. Each clock supports timezone
                                    changes everywhere, including summer and
                                    winter time.

                                    Based on previous solutions, I debuted as a

                                    processor with Node.js to grab products from
                                    Amazon and republish them in Mercado Libre,
                                    a Latin American marketplace. By
                                    interchanging tokens and keys, I used
                                    existing APIs from web scrappers for data
                                    gathering and integration.

                                    The Rodriguez family has owned a local
                                    nursery for decades, giving their customers
                                    quality products and service; Lifether
                                    reflected that in their first online store
                                    to appeal to that entrepreneurial thinking.
                                    The site served as a landing page and a
                                    sales channel so customers could browse,
                                    share, and purchase their favorite sprouts.
                                    Growing the customer base became an
                                    important milestone, so the Lifether team
                                    connected the Rodriguez and valley
                                    communities by running social media
